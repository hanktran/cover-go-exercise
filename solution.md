## Gather Informations
* Read and analyze to understand the requirements.
* Decided to build project with ReactJS, ReduxToolkit, TypeScript, Tailwind
  * ReactJS
    1. ReactJs is what I am most familiar with.
  * ReduxToolkit
    1. Because I realized that data was shared between some screens.
    1. But in this assignment, ReduxToolkit is not necessary. I think we can achieve the same delivery with ReactJS.
    1. But I still use ReduxToolkit because I already installed it
  * TypeScript
    1. It helps me develop faster with fewer bugs.
    1. But it needs more time to refresh the app because it needs to be compiled to JavaScript.
  * Tailwind
    1. It is a great tool.
    1. This assignment is a chance for me to practice it.
    1. And I do not want to spend a lot of time styling.

## Build project
### Establish project structure
### Sometime I need to refactor code, break component, fix bugs.

# Need TODO
 * Write Unit test
 * Fix bugs
